# ITI Graduation Project - Performance Testing with JMeter
Welcome to the repository for my ITI graduation project, where I conducted a comprehensive performance testing on the [OpenCart platform](opencart.abstracta.us) using JMeter. This project features various scenarios to evaluate the platform's responsiveness and stability under different conditions.

## Project Overview
As part of this project, I focused on the following key aspects:

### 📋 End-to-End Scenarios
- 🛍️ Registration and 1st Purchase Scenario:
 - Implemented using the JMeter Script Recorder.
 - Covered the entire process from user registration to completing the 1st purchase.
- 🛍️ Login and 2nd Purchase Scenario:
 - Implemented using the JMeter Script Recorder.
 - Covered the entire process from user login to completing the 2nd purchase.
- ⚙️ Utilized essential JMeter components such as Assertions, Logic Controllers, Listeners, and Regular Expression Extractors to handle dynamic variables and enhance result accuracy.

### 📈 Load Testing
- Examined platform responsiveness under normal and peak loads.
- Using jp@gc - Stepping Thread Group and jp@gc - Ultimate Thread Group

### 📈 Stress Testing
- Evaluated the platform's stability and behavior under stress conditions.
- Using jp@gc - Stepping Thread Group and jp@gc - Ultimate Thread Group

### 📈 Spike Testing
- Analyzed how the platform responds to sudden increases in load.
- Using jp@gc - Ultimate Thread Group

### 📈 Endurance Testing
- Tested the platform's stability over an extended period.
- Using jp@gc - Ultimate Thread Group

### 🆗 API Performance Testing
- Tested the performance of the API.
- Covering GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

### 📂 FTP Server Performance Testing
- Tested the performance of the FTP server.
- Covering the upload and download scenarios.

### 🗄️ SQL Server Local Database Performance Testing
- Used JDBC Connection to test the performance of the local SQL server database.

### 🗄️ MySQL Online Database Performance Testing
- Used [db4free.net/phpMyAdmin](db4free.net/phpMyAdmin) through JDBC Connection to test the performance of the online MySQL database.
- Covering reading and writing to the database.

### 📧 Email Server Performance Testing
- Performed performance testing using SMTP Connection.

### 📊 Reporting
- Generated test reports in both CSV and HTML formats using:
 - Non-GUI Mode (CMD).
 - JMeter GUI Mode.

 - `Search Data.csv`: Contains search keywords for product searches on the OpenCart platform.
 - `Test Data.csv`: Includes First names, Last names, Emails, Mobile numbers, and Passwords for registration and login scenarios.
- `results/`: Holds the CSV and HTML reports generated from the conducted tests.
 - `XXX HTML Report/`: Includes the HTML Report generated by running each test case individually.
 - `All HTML Report/`: Contains the HTML Report generated by executing the entire test plan.
 - `XXX.csv`: The CSV Report generated by running each test case individually.
 - `AllReport.csv`: The CSV Report generated by executing the entire test plan.
- `Project.jmx`: Main JMeter test plan featuring all performance test cases.
